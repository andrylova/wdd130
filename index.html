        <p>Hello! My name is RATSIATOSIKA Lovamampionona Andry. I am from Antsirabe, Madagascar.
            I really enjoy playing and watching soccer. I am currently a student at UVU and and
            pursue Web Design and Development. I am happy that I can create this web page and learn
            through it.

        <p> Madagascar is a large island nation located off the southeastern coast of Africa in the Indian
            Ocean.
            It is famous for its unique biodiversity, with over 90% of its wildlife- such as lemurs and Baobab
            trees-found nowhere else on Earth. The island's landscapes range from rainforests and mountains to
            dry deserts and coral reefs. Culturally, Madagascar blends influences from Africa, Asia and Europe,
            reflected in its languages, cuisine and traditions.
