        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, I am Andry" width="200">
        <p>Hello! My name is RATSIATOSIKA Lovamampionona Andry. I am from Antsirabe, Madagascar.
            I really enjoy playing and watching soccer. I am currently a student at UVU and and
            pursue Web Design and Development. I am happy that I can create this web page and learn
            through it.
            In my free time, I also love reading books and playing with my child. I am fascinated by
            how websites are designed and how they work behind the scenes. My goal is to become a skilled
            web developer who can create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I enjoy collaborating
            with others and sharing ideas to solve problems creatively. I am excited about the future and
            the opportunities that learning web development will bring.
            I also love my country, Madagascar, for its beautiful beaches and amazing landscapes. Exploring places
            like Sainte Marie and Nosy Be fills me with joy and inspiration. I appreciate the diversity of our culture,
            from traditional music to local cuisine, which makes life here so vibrant. Madagascar's unique wildlife and
            natural beauty motivated me to share experiences and heritage with others. Traveling and discovering new
            parts
            of my country gives me a sense of adventure and pride. Being able to combine my passion for web development
            with
            for Madagascar is something I look forward to in the future.

        <h2>Madagascar my country</h2>
        <img src="images/madagascar1.jpg" alt="Allée des Baobab Morondava, Madagascar">
        <p> Madagascar is a large island nation located off the southeastern coast of Africa in the Indian
            Ocean.
            It is famous for its unique biodiversity, with over 90% of its wildlife- such as lemurs and Baobab
            trees-found nowhere else on Earth. The island's landscapes range from rainforests and mountains to
            dry deserts and coral reefs. Culturally, Madagascar blends influences from Africa, Asia and Europe,
            reflected in its languages, cuisine and traditions.
